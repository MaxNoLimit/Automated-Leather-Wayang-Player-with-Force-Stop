Experiment 11/11/2024

1. Experiment 1

- Attempt 1: (lcd broke while playing)
	MainLoop stack: 512
	MainLoop priority: 1
	Episode stack: 1024
	Episode priority: 1

- Attempt 2: (lcd broke while playing same as attempt 1)
	MainLoop stack: 1024
	MainLoop priority: 1
	Episode stack: 1024
	Episode priority: 1


Conclusion: bad display algorithm while playing episode or wrong priority management, since stack size doesnt affect the lcd broke

2. Experiment 2

- Attempt 1: (lcd didnt break while playing but horizontal movement stutter like move a little bit, not like usual)
	MainLoop stack: 1024
	MainLoop priority: 2
	Episode stack: 1024
	Episode priority: 1

- Attempt 2: (same as attempt 1)
	MainLoop stack: 512
	MainLoop priority: 2
	Episode stack: 1024
	Episode priority: 1

Conclusion: bad horizontal movement algorithm, mainloop stack is okay with 512 and episode stack is already enough with 1024 since every fight task, use 2x 352 = 716 bytes

Solusion for bad horizontal movement algorithm: while doing horizontal movement, mainloop task is suspended then resumed after done moving
